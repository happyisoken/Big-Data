    "\n",
    "These are very large datasets that are being generated very rapidly. It is defined as an enormous amount of unstructured and fast moving data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Three qualities attributed to Big data are:\n",
    "1. Volume - More and more data is becoming increasingly available(size)\n",
    "2. Velocity - Data is being generated at an astonishing rate(speed)\n",
    "3. Variety - The data we can analyse comes in many forms.\n",
    "\n",

    "##### Challenges with big data\n",
    "1. It is big.\n",
    "2. It is constantly changing and updating\n",
    "3. The variety can be overwhelming\n",
    "4. It is messy (unstructured)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How Big data is used in different industries\n",
    "1. Personalization of offerings: E.g. Amazon uses big data to know their customers and offer customize solutions.\n",
    "2. Fraud reduction: Credit card companies like visa analyze transactions to identify unusual patterns. There reduce fraud in real time.\n",
    "3. Predictive maintenance: Companies can use use data collected about operations to predict performance issues before they happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big data has many more application areas accross all industries. It is estimated that leaders in big data generate an average of 12% more revenue that those who those that do not maximise their use of analytics. If a company wants their customer data to be their competitive advantage, trust is something they do not want to lose. Customers reaction to data misuse can cause them to reduece their spending with the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How big data can trigger digital transformation.\n",
    "- Use of video tracking data\n",
    "- It requires fundamental changes to their approach towards data, employees and customers and it will affect their organizational culture.\n",
    "- Digital transformation impacts every aspect of an organization. So it is handled by decision makers at top levels to ensure success.\n",
    "- The support of the CEO is crucial to the digital transformation process. As is the support of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Data Officer and Chief Information Officer. They also require support from the executives who control Budgets, personnel decision and day-to-day priorities. Everyone must support for it to succeed.   \n",
    "- It is the way to succeed now and in the future "

    "According to Ernst and Young, Big Data refers to the dynamic, large and disparate volumes of data being created by people, tools and machines. It requires new, innovative and scalable technology to collect, host and analytically process the vast amount of data gathered in order to derive real-time business insights that relate to consumers, risk, profit, performance, productivity management, and enhanced shareholder value.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Elements of big data (The V's of Big Data)\n",
    "1. Velocity - The speed at which big data accumulates or the pace at which data is growing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Volume - The scale of the data or the increase in the amount of data stored. \n",
    "Drivers of volume are: \n",
    "    - the increase in data sources, \n",
    "    - higher resolution sensors,  \n",
    "    - scalable infrastructure. \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Variety - The diversity of the data. It also reflects that data comes from different sources - machines, people and processes both internal and external to organizations.\n",
    "Structured data fits neatly into rows and columns in relational databases. While unstructured data is now organized in a pre-defined way like twits, blog posts, pictures, numbers and videos.\n",
    "Drivers of variety are:\n",
    "    - Mobile technologies\n",
    "    - Social media\n",
    "    - Wearable technologies\n",
    "    - Geo technologies\n",
    "    - Video\n",
    "    - And many more.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Veracity - The quality and origin of data and its conformity to facts and accuracy. \n",
    "The attributes include:\n",
    "    - Consistency\n",
    "    - Completeness\n",
    "    - Integrity\n",
    "    - Ambuguity\n",
    "Drivers include:\n",
    "    - Cost\n",
    "    - Need for traceability.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. Value - The ability and need to turn data into value. It isn't just profit. It may have medical or social profits as well as customer, employee or personal satisfaction. The main reason that people invest time to understand big data is the value derived from it."
